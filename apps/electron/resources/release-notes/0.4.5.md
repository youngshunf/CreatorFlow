# v0.4.5 — Slack Token Fix & Copilot Bundling

Hotfix release that resolves Slack sources being unusable due to the token refresh system incorrectly handling non-refreshable OAuth tokens, plus Copilot CLI bundling improvements.

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed non-refreshable OAuth tokens (Slack) being broken by `ensureFreshToken()` — tokens without a `refreshToken` (e.g. Slack bot tokens) now return as-is instead of falling through to a refresh that fails and marks the source `needs_auth` (e358e414)
- Fixed refresh cooldown not clearing on re-authentication — after re-authenticating a source, the 5-minute cooldown is now immediately cleared so the source is usable without waiting (e358e414)
- Fixed Copilot CLI on Windows — added `copilot.exe` to `extraResources` to avoid EBUSY file locking during electron-builder packaging (d4cda5f2)
- Added `copilot` to the LLM provider type validator schema (d4cda5f2)

## Build & CI

- Added Copilot CLI bundle verification to CI workflows for all platforms (macOS arm64/x64, Linux, Windows) (d4cda5f2)
- Copilot CLI native binary now properly vendored per-platform in build scripts with size verification (d4cda5f2)

## Documentation

- Added Troubleshooting section with debug mode commands to README (53394694)
