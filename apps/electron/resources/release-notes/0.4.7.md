# v0.4.7 — Multi-Tier Skill Resolution Fix

Targeted bugfix release resolving a critical issue where skills from global (`~/.agents/`) and project-level (`.agents/`) directories failed to invoke despite being visible in the UI.

---

## Bug Fixes

- **Skills from global/project directories fail with "Unknown skill"** — The UI discovered skills from all 3 tiers (global, workspace, project) via `loadAllSkills`, but the SDK backend only registered the workspace directory as a plugin. Global and project-level skills were shown as invocable but returned "Unknown skill" when used. Fixed by registering all 3 skill directories as SDK plugins, rewriting `qualifySkillName` to resolve the correct plugin prefix per tier, and fixing the UI mention menu to use the correct plugin qualifier based on skill source (0fb687d5)
- **Feature flags not bundled in packaged app** — `feature-flags.ts` was missing from the build script's copy step, causing packaged builds (especially Windows) to fail to load compile-time feature flags (6268fefd, c44899cb)

## Improvements

- **GitHub issue templates** — Added structured templates for bug reports and feature requests to the OSS repository (35123388)

## Internal

- **sourceTemplates feature flag disabled** — Rolled back to `false` pending further stabilization (9f375b4f)
