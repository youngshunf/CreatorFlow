# Research

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Multi-source research on a customer question, product topic, or account-related inquiry. Synthesizes findings from all available sources with clear attribution.

## Usage

```
/research <question or topic>
```

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the Research Request

Identify what type of research is needed:
- **Customer question**: Something a customer has asked that needs an answer (e.g., "Does our product support SSO with Okta?")
- **Issue investigation**: Background on a reported problem (e.g., "Has this bug been reported before? What's the known workaround?")
- **Account context**: History with a specific customer (e.g., "What did we tell Acme Corp last time they asked about this?")
- **Topic research**: General topic relevant to support work (e.g., "Best practices for webhook retry logic")

### 2. Search Available Sources

Search in priority order, adapting to what is connected:

**Tier 1 — Internal Documentation (highest confidence):**
- ~~knowledge base (if connected): product docs, runbooks, FAQs
- ~~cloud storage: internal documents, specs, guides, past research
- ~~CRM notes: previous answers to similar questions, account context

**Tier 2 — Team Communications:**
- ~~chat: search for the topic in relevant channels; check if teammates have discussed or answered this before
- ~~email: search for previous correspondence on this topic
- ~~support platform (if connected): check if this has been asked/resolved before

**Tier 3 — External Sources:**
- Web search: official documentation, blog posts, community forums
- Public knowledge bases, help centers, release notes

### 3. Synthesize Findings

Compile results into a structured research brief:

```
## Research: [Question/Topic]

### Answer
[Clear, direct answer to the question — lead with the bottom line]

**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]
[Explain what drives the confidence level]

### Key Findings

**From [Source 1]:**
- [Finding with specific detail]
- [Finding with specific detail]

**From [Source 2]:**
- [Finding with specific detail]

### Context & Nuance
[Any caveats, edge cases, or additional context that matters]

### Sources
1. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]
2. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]
3. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]

### Gaps & Unknowns
- [What couldn't be confirmed]
- [What might need verification from a subject matter expert]

### Recommended Next Steps
- [Action if the answer needs to go to a customer]
- [Action if further research is needed]
- [Who to consult for verification if needed]
```

### 4. Handle Insufficient Sources

If no connected sources yield results:

- Perform web research on the topic
- Ask the user for internal context:
  - "I couldn't find this in connected sources. Do you have internal docs or knowledge base articles about this?"
  - "Has your team discussed this topic before? Any ~~chat channels I should check?"
  - "Is there a subject matter expert who would know the answer?"
- Be transparent about limitations:
  - "This answer is based on web research only — please verify against your internal documentation before sharing with the customer."
  - "I found a possible answer but couldn't confirm it from an authoritative internal source."

### 5. Customer-Facing Considerations

If the research is to answer a customer question:

- Flag if the answer involves product roadmap, pricing, legal, or security topics that may need review
- Note if the answer differs from what may have been communicated previously
- Suggest appropriate caveats for the customer-facing response
- Offer to draft the customer response: "Want me to draft a response to the customer based on these findings?"

### 6. Knowledge Capture

After research is complete, suggest capturing the knowledge:

- "Should I save these findings to your knowledge base for future reference?"
- "Want me to create a FAQ entry based on this research?"
- "This might be worth documenting — should I draft a runbook entry?"

This helps build institutional knowledge and reduces duplicate research effort across the team.
