**You'll invest time once to save years of potential missteps.**

## Phase-by-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Before Starting)

**Gather Your Context:**
1. **Your background:**
   - Research area/field
   - Current position (grad student, postdoc, PI, etc.)
   - Lab expertise and resources
   - Timeline constraints

2. **Your starting point:**
   - Vague area of interest?
   - Specific problem in mind?
   - Must build on existing work?
   - Starting completely fresh?

3. **Your goals:**
   - Publication target (journal tier, timeline)?
   - Degree requirement (thesis chapter)?
   - Funding application?
   - Startup foundation?
   - Career development?

**Set Expectations:**
- This process will challenge your assumptions
- You may discover your initial idea needs major revision
- That's the point—better to know now than after 2 years
- Intellectual honesty is required; this only works if you're rigorous

### Phase 2: Ideation (Skill 1) - ~1 week

**What We'll Do:**
1. Understand your context and constraints
2. Work through relevant intuition pumps
3. Avoid common ideation traps
4. Generate 2-3 project ideas
5. Preliminary literature search to calibrate scope
6. Select most promising idea
7. Create Problem Ideation Document (2 pages)

**Literature Integration Point 1:**
- Search PubMed for precedents and adjacent work
- Assess generality of problem
- Identify methodological advances
- Determine competition level

**Deliverable:**
- Problem Ideation Document with core idea and initial analysis
- List of 10-15 key papers
- Preliminary assessment of novelty and feasibility

**Checkpoint:** Do you have a clear, specific idea that excites you? If not, iterate on intuition pumps.

### Phase 3: Risk Analysis (Skill 2) - ~3-5 days

**What We'll Do:**
1. Extract ALL assumptions from your idea
2. Categorize (biological vs. technical)
3. Score each assumption (risk 1-5, time to test)
4. Identify high-risk late-reading assumptions
5. Design go/no-go experiments
6. Develop mitigation strategies
7. Create Risk Assessment Matrix (2 pages)

**Literature Integration Point 2:**
- Search for technical precedents (has method worked before?)
- Find biological evidence (what's known about your system?)
- Identify benchmarks (success rates, effect sizes)
- Assess timeline realism

**Deliverable:**
- Complete assumption analysis table
- Top 3 high-risk assumptions with mitigation plans
- Go/no-go experiment designs
- Revised timeline with decision points

**Checkpoint:** Is your risk profile acceptable? If risk-5 assumptions are >2 years out, return to Skill 1 to reframe.

- Flexibility matrix for contingencies
- Project ensemble (family of related projects)

**Checkpoint:** Have you fixed 1-2 meaningful parameters while maintaining flexibility? If too rigid, adjust.

### Phase 6: Decision Tree Planning (Skill 5) - ~2 days

**What We'll Do:**
1. Map your project's decision tree
2. Identify major branch points
3. Set criteria for each decision
4. Establish Level 1 / Level 2 rhythm

## Iteration and Refinement

### When to Iterate

**Red Flags That Require Going Back:**

**From Skill 2 (Risk):**
- Risk-5 assumptions >2 years out → Return to Skill 1 (reframe problem)
- >3 risk-4-5 assumptions → Return to Skill 1 (simplify or change approach)

**From Skill 3 (Impact):**
- Score LOW on both axes → Return to Skill 1 (find higher-impact angle)
- Optimization function mismatch → Return to Skill 1 (reframe problem)

**From Skill 4 (Parameters):**
- >2 fixed parameters → Return to Skill 1 (over-constrained)
- Zero fixed parameters → Return to Skill 1 (under-constrained)

**From Skills 5-6:**
- No clear decision points → Return to Skill 4 (need more flexibility)
- Every failure mode is existential → Return to Skill 2 (too risky)

### Iteration Protocol

**Major Revision Needed:**
1. **Pause and acknowledge:** The process is working—it caught a problem
2. **Return to indicated skill:** Usually Skill 1 or 2
3. **Bring forward what you learned:** Don't start from scratch
4. **Revised idea → Run through workflow again:** Faster the second time
5. **Multiple iterations OK:** Better than years on wrong project

**Minor Refinement:**
1. **Update specific document:** E.g., adjust parameter strategy
2. **Check downstream effects:** Does this change anything else?
3. **Update integration document:** Keep everything coherent

## Literature Integration Strategy

### Overall PubMed Approach

**Throughout the workflow, use PubMed strategically:**

1. **Skill 1 (Ideation):** Assess generality, find precedents, gauge competition
2. **Skill 2 (Risk):** Technical feasibility, biological evidence, benchmarks
3. **Skill 3 (Impact):** Field exemplars, evaluation frameworks, benchmarks
4. **Skill 4 (Parameters):** Successful parameter choices, cautionary tales
5. **Skill 6 (Adversity):** Productive pivots, upgrade examples
6. **Skill 8 (Integration):** Communication models, comprehensive references

**Search Strategy:**
- Start broad (field overview)
- Get specific (your exact approach)
- Look adjacent (related systems/methods)
- Find benchmarks (what's state-of-art?)
- Identify competition (who else is doing this?)

**Papers to Track:**
- ~10-15 key papers from Skill 1
- ~5-10 technical papers from Skill 2
- ~5-10 impact exemplars from Skill 3
- ~5 parameter lessons from Skill 4
- ~3-5 pivot examples from Skill 6
- **Total: ~30-50 papers** (your foundation)
