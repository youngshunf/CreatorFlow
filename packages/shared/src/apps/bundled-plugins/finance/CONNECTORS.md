# Connectors

## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~data warehouse` might mean Snowflake, BigQuery, or any other warehouse with an MCP server.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories (data warehouse, chat, project tracker, etc.) rather than specific products. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures specific MCP servers, but any MCP server in that category works.
