# Performance Report

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate a marketing performance report with key metrics, trend analysis, insights, and optimization recommendations.

## Trigger

User runs `/performance-report` or asks for a marketing report, performance analysis, campaign results, or metrics summary.

## Inputs

1. **Report type** — determine which type of report the user needs:
   - **Campaign report** — performance of a specific campaign
   - **Channel report** — performance across a specific channel (email, social, paid, SEO, etc.)
   - **Content performance** — how content pieces are performing
   - **Overall marketing report** — cross-channel summary (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
   - **Custom** — user-defined scope

2. **Time period** — the reporting window (last week, last month, last quarter, custom date range)

3. **Data source**:
   - If ~~product analytics is connected: pull performance data automatically
   - If not connected: ask the user to provide metrics. Prompt with: "Please paste or share your performance data. I can work with spreadsheets, CSV data, dashboard screenshots described in text, or just the key numbers."

4. **Comparison period** (optional) — prior period or year-over-year for trend context

5. **Stakeholder audience** (optional) — who will read this report (executive summary style vs. detailed analyst view)

## Report Structure

For each recommendation:
- What to do
- Why (linked to a specific insight from the data)
- Expected impact (high, medium, low)
- Effort to implement (high, medium, low)
- Priority (immediate, next sprint, next quarter)

Prioritize recommendations in a 2x2 matrix format:

| | Low Effort | High Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | Do first | Plan for next sprint |
| **Low Impact** | Do if time allows | Deprioritize |

### 8. Next Period Focus

- Tests or experiments to run
- Targets for key metrics

## Output Formatting

- Use tables for data presentation
- Bold key numbers and trends
- Keep the executive summary concise (suitable for forwarding to leadership)
- Include a "detailed appendix" section for granular data if the user provided a lot of metrics

## After the Report

Ask: "Would you like me to:
- Create a slide-ready summary of these results?
- Draft a stakeholder email with the key takeaways?
- Dive deeper into any specific metric or channel?
- Set up a reporting template you can reuse next period?"
