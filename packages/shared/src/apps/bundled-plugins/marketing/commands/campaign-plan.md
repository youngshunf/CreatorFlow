> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate a comprehensive marketing campaign brief with objectives, audience, messaging, channel strategy, content calendar, and success metrics.

## Trigger

User runs `/campaign-plan` or asks to plan, design, or build a marketing campaign.

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

1. **Campaign goal** — the primary objective (e.g., drive signups, increase awareness, launch a product, generate leads, re-engage churned users)

2. **Target audience** — who the campaign is aimed at (demographics, roles, industries, pain points, buying stage)

3. **Timeline** — campaign duration and any fixed dates (launch date, event date, seasonal deadline)

4. **Budget range** — approximate budget or budget tier (optional; if not provided, generate a channel-agnostic plan and note where budget allocation would matter)

5. **Additional context** (optional):
   - Product or service being promoted
   - Key differentiators or value propositions
   - Previous campaign performance or learnings
   - Brand guidelines or constraints
   - Geographic focus

## Campaign Brief Structure

Generate a campaign brief with the following sections:

### 1. Campaign Overview
- Campaign name suggestion
- One-sentence campaign summary
- Primary objective with a specific, measurable goal
- Secondary objectives (if applicable)

### 2. Target Audience
- Primary audience segment with description
- Secondary audience segment (if applicable)
- Audience pain points and motivations
- Where they spend time (channels, communities, publications)
- Buying stage alignment (awareness, consideration, decision)

### 3. Key Messages
- Core campaign message (one sentence)
- 3-4 supporting messages tailored to audience pain points
- Message variations by channel (if different tones are needed)
- Proof points or evidence to support each message

### 4. Channel Strategy
Recommend channels based on audience and goal. For each channel, include:
- Why this channel fits the audience and objective
- Content format recommendations
- Estimated effort level (low, medium, high)
- Budget allocation suggestion (if budget was provided)

Consider channels from:
- Owned: blog, email, website, social media profiles
- Earned: PR, influencer partnerships, guest posts, community engagement
- Paid: search ads, social ads, display, sponsored content, events

### 5. Content Calendar
Create a week-by-week (or day-by-day for short campaigns) content calendar:
- What content to produce each week
- Which channel each piece targets
- Key milestones and deadlines
- Dependencies between pieces (e.g., "landing page must be live before paid ads launch")

Format as a table:

| Week | Content Piece | Channel | Owner/Notes | Status |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------|--------|

### 6. Content Pieces Needed
List every content asset required for the campaign:
- Asset name and type (blog post, email, social post, ad creative, landing page, etc.)
- Brief description of what it should contain
- Priority (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- Suggested timeline for creation

### 7. Success Metrics
Define KPIs aligned to the campaign objective:
- Primary KPI with target number
- Secondary KPIs (3-5)
- How each metric will be tracked
- Reporting cadence recommendation

If ~~product analytics is connected, reference any available historical performance benchmarks to inform targets.

### 8. Budget Allocation (if budget provided)
- Breakdown by channel or activity
- Production costs vs. distribution costs
- Contingency recommendation (typically 10-15%)

### 9. Risks and Mitigations
- 2-3 potential risks (timeline, audience mismatch, channel underperformance)
- Mitigation strategy for each

### 10. Next Steps
- Immediate action items to kick off the campaign
- Stakeholder approvals needed
- Key decision points

## Output

Present the full campaign brief with clear headings and formatting. After the brief, ask:

"Would you like me to:
- Dive deeper into any section?
- Draft specific content pieces from the calendar?
- Create a competitive analysis to inform the messaging?
- Adjust the plan for a different budget or timeline?"
