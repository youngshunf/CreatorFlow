# Draft Content

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate marketing content drafts tailored to a specific content type, audience, and brand voice.

## Trigger

User runs `/draft-content` or asks to draft, write, or create marketing content.

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

1. **Content type** — one of:
   - Blog post
   - Social media post (specify platform: LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook)
   - Email newsletter
   - Landing page copy
   - Press release
   - Case study

2. **Topic** — the subject or theme of the content

3. **Target audience** — who this content is for (role, industry, seniority, pain points)

4. **Key messages** — 2-4 main points or takeaways to communicate

5. **Tone** — e.g., authoritative, conversational, inspirational, technical, witty (optional if brand voice is configured)

6. **Length** — target word count or format constraint (e.g., "1000 words", "280 characters", "3 paragraphs")

## Brand Voice

- If the user has a brand voice configured in their local settings file, apply it automatically. Inform the user that brand voice settings are being applied.
- If no brand voice is configured, ask: "Do you have brand voice guidelines you'd like me to follow? If not, I'll use a neutral professional tone."
- Apply the specified or default tone consistently throughout the draft.

## Content Generation by Type

## SEO Considerations (for web content)

For blog posts, landing pages, and other web-facing content:

- Recommend keyword placement: headline, first paragraph, subheadings, meta description
- Suggest internal and external linking opportunities
- Recommend a meta description (under 160 characters)
- Note image alt text opportunities

## Output

Present the draft with clear formatting. After the draft, include:
- A brief note on what brand voice and tone were applied
- Any SEO recommendations (for web content)
- Suggestions for next steps (e.g., "Review with your team", "Add customer quotes", "Pair with a visual")

Ask: "Would you like me to revise any section, adjust the tone, or create a variation for a different channel?"
