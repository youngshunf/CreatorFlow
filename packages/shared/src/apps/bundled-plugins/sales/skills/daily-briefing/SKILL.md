## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**If no calendar connected:**
> "What meetings do you have today? (Just paste your calendar or list them)"

**If no CRM connected:**
> "What deals are you focused on this week? Any that need attention?"

**If you have connectors:**
I'll pull everything automatically and just show you the briefing.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Calendar** | Today's meetings with attendees, times, and context |
| **CRM** | Open pipeline, deals closing soon, overdue tasks, stale deals |
| **Email** | Unread from opportunity contacts, emails waiting on replies |
| **Enrichment** | Overnight signals: funding, hiring, news on your accounts |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Tell me your meetings and deals, and I'll create your briefing.

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Context

**If connectors available:**
```
1. Calendar → Get today's events
   - Filter to external meetings (non-company attendees)
   - Pull: time, title, attendees, description

2. CRM → Query your pipeline
   - Open opportunities owned by you
   - Flag: closing this week, no activity 7+ days, slipped dates
   - Get: overdue tasks, upcoming tasks

3. Email → Check priority messages
   - Unread from opportunity contact domains
   - Sent messages with no reply (3+ days)

4. Enrichment → Check signals (if available)
   - Funding, hiring, news on open accounts
```

**If no connectors:**
```
Ask user:
1. "What meetings do you have today?"
2. "What deals are you focused on? Any closing soon or needing attention?"
3. "Anything urgent I should know about?"

Work with whatever they provide.
```

### Step 2: Prioritize

```
Priority ranking:
1. URGENT: Deal closing today/tomorrow not yet won
2. HIGH: Meeting today with high-value opportunity
3. HIGH: Unread email from decision-maker
4. MEDIUM: Deal closing this week
5. MEDIUM: Stale deal (7+ days no activity)
6. LOW: Tasks due this week

Select #1 Priority:
- If meeting with >$50K deal today → prep that
- If deal closing today → focus on close
- If urgent email from buyer → respond first
- Else → highest-value stale deal
```

### Step 3: Generate Briefing

```
Assemble sections based on available data:

1. #1 Priority — Always include (even if simple)
2. Today's Numbers — If CRM connected, otherwise skip
3. Today's Meetings — From calendar or user input
4. Pipeline Alerts — If CRM connected
5. Email Priorities — If email connected
6. Suggested Actions — Always include top 3 actions
```

## Quick Mode

Say "quick brief" or "tldr my day" for abbreviated version:

```markdown
# Quick Brief | [Date]

**#1:** [Priority action]

**Meetings:** [N] — [Company 1], [Company 2], [Company 3]

**Alerts:**
- [Alert 1]
- [Alert 2]

**Do Now:** [Single most important action]
```

---

## End of Day Mode

Say "wrap up my day" or "end of day summary" after your last meeting:

```markdown
# End of Day | [Date]

**Completed:**
- [Meeting 1] — [Outcome]
- [Meeting 2] — [Outcome]

**Pipeline Changes:**
- [Deal] moved to [Stage]

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] [Unfinished item needing follow-up]
```

## Tips

1. **Connect your calendar first** — Biggest time saver
2. **Add CRM second** — Unlocks pipeline alerts
3. **Even without connectors** — Just tell me your meetings and I'll help prioritize
