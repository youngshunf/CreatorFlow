## Rendering Guidelines

### geometric

**Headlines**: Modern geometric sans-serif with clean angles and consistent stroke width. Think Futura, Avenir, or Proxima Nova. Bold to semi-bold weight. Perfect circles in O, G characters.

**Body**: Clean sans-serif optimized for readability. Regular weight. Consistent x-height. Sufficient letter spacing.

**Characteristics**:
- Mathematical precision in letterforms
- Consistent stroke widths
- Perfect geometry in curves
- Modern, authoritative presence

### humanist

**Headlines**: Friendly sans-serif with subtle stroke variations. Think Frutiger, Open Sans, or Myriad. Medium to semi-bold weight. Warm, approachable letterforms.

**Characteristics**:
- Warm, approachable feel
- Subtle stroke contrast
- Open counters for readability
- Natural, human touch

### handwritten

**Headlines**: Bold hand-written marker or brush lettering. Thick strokes with organic edges. Slightly uneven baseline. Render as actual hand-drawn letters.

**Body**: Clear handwritten style mimicking notes. Casual but legible. Natural variation in letter forms.

**Characteristics**:
- Organic, imperfect letterforms
- Visible brush/pen character

### technical

**Characteristics**:
- Monospace for data elements
- Precise alignment
- Clear number distinction (0 vs O, 1 vs l)

## Font Rendering Instructions

Since image generators cannot use font names, describe visual characteristics:

| Option | Headline Description | Body Description |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| geometric | "bold geometric sans-serif with perfect circular O shapes" | "clean modern sans-serif" |
| humanist | "friendly rounded sans-serif with warm letterforms" | "readable humanist sans-serif" |
| handwritten | "bold hand-drawn marker lettering with organic strokes" | "casual handwritten notes style" |
| editorial | "dramatic high-contrast serif with thick-thin stroke variation" | "elegant classic serif" |
| technical | "precise sans-serif with monospace numbers" | "technical sans-serif, fixed-width for code" |

## Combination Notes

| Typography | Works Best With | Avoid With |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| geometric | clean texture, professional/neutral mood | organic texture |
| humanist | organic/clean texture, warm mood | pixel texture |
| handwritten | organic/paper texture, warm/vibrant mood | grid texture, professional mood |
| editorial | clean texture, vibrant/professional mood | pixel texture |
| technical | grid/clean texture, cool/dark mood | paper texture, warm mood |
