Retro 8-bit pixel art aesthetic with nostalgic gaming visual style

## Design Aesthetic

Pixelated retro aesthetic reminiscent of classic 8-bit and 16-bit era games. Chunky pixels, limited color palettes, and nostalgic gaming references. Simple geometric shapes rendered in blocky pixel form. Fun, playful, and immediately recognizable retro tech aesthetic.

## Background

- Color: Light Blue (#87CEEB) or Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA)
- Texture: Subtle pixel grid pattern, CRT scanline effect optional

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Pixelated bitmap font style. Chunky, blocky letterforms with visible pixel structure. All caps for maximum readability. Render as actual pixel art, not smooth vectors.

### Secondary Font (Body)

Smaller pixel font with consistent 8x8 or 16x16 character grid. High contrast against background. Limited anti-aliasing to maintain retro feel.
