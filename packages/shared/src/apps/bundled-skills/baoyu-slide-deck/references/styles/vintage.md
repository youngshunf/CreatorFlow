Vintage aged-paper aesthetic for historical and expedition-style presentations

## Design Aesthetic

Nostalgic vintage aesthetic with aged paper textures and historical document styling. Think explorer's journals, antique maps, and museum exhibits. Rich warm tones with weathered textures. Evokes discovery, heritage, and timeless knowledge.

## Background

- Color: Aged Parchment (#F5E6D3) or Sepia Cream (#FFF8DC)
- Texture: Heavy aged paper texture with subtle creases, coffee stains, and worn edges

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Classic serif with historical character (Garamond, Baskerville, or similar). Elegant, authoritative, timeless. May include decorative flourishes.

### Secondary Font (Labels)

Condensed serif or clean sans-serif for map labels and annotations. Period-appropriate styling. Consistent with vintage aesthetic.

### Body Font

Readable serif for longer text. Traditional book typography. Comfortable reading experience.
