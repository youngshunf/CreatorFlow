Technical briefing infographic style with aged paper texture and bilingual explanatory text boxes

## Design Aesthetic

Academic/technical briefing presentation style, NOT artistic 3D renders. Clean 2D or isometric technical illustrations with multiple explanatory text boxes containing article content. Split layouts with visuals on left/center and text on right/bottom. Information-dense but organized with clear visual hierarchy. Vintage blueprint aesthetic with modern clarity.

## Background

- Color: Aged Cream (#F5F0E6)
- Texture: Subtle paper texture with light creases, warm nostalgic feel reminiscent of vintage technical prints

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Bold display font in dark maroon, ALL CAPS in brackets for main titles. English subtitle below in smaller size. Technical, authoritative presence with vintage character.

### Secondary Font (Labels)

Clean sans-serif for bilingual callout labels. Format: "ENGLISH TERM 中文翻译". High contrast against background.

### Body Font

Clean geometric sans-serif for text box content. Readable at smaller sizes. Consistent weight throughout.
